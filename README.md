# MagicOSThemeMaker

### App that can create themes for MagisOS (and possibly for EMUI) written on C# (.NET Framework 4.8) with WPF.
So, since in MagicOS was no Material You, and still was old, rusty theme engine, i made this app. But material 3 is not limit!

All of UI was made from scratch, and colors fetches from windows accent color. :3
